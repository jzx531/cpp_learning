# FFT Demo
This is a simple demo of the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm and DFT algorithm in C++.
## Usage
to use this demo ï¼Œyou need to use linux system and g++ compiler and make

``` bash
sudo apt-get install build-essential
```
install mathgl library
``` bash
sudo apt-get install libmathgl-dev
```
build this demo
``` bash
make
```
## Example
``` bash
./output/fft_demo
```
then the result will be shown in the console.
and the amplitude and phase of the signal will be shown in test.png.
